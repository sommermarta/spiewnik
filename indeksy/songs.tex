\begin{song2}{Ć Right Here Waiting}{ŚRICHARD MARX}
\noindent
Oceans apart day after day\\
And I slowly go insane\\
I hear your voice on the line\\
But it doesn't stop the pain\\
\\
If I see you next to never\\
How can we say forever\\
\\
Wherever you go\\
Whatever you do\\
I will be right here waiting for you\\
Whatever it takes\\
Or how my heart breaks\\
I will be right here waiting for you\\
\\
I took for granted, all the times\\
That I though would last somehow\\
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears\\
But I can't get near you now\\
\\
Oh, can't you see it baby\\
You've got me goin' crazy\\
\\
Wherever you go\\
Whatever you do\\
I will be right here waiting for you\\
Whatever it takes\\
Or how my heart breaks\\
I will be right here waiting for you\\
\vfill
\columnbreak
\noindent
I wonder how we can survive\\
This romance\\
But in the end if I'm with you\\
I'll take the chance\\
\\
Oh, can't you see it baby\\
You've got me goin' crazy\\
\\
Wherever you go\\
Whatever you do\\
I will be right here waiting for you\\
Whatever it takes\\
Or how my heart breaks\\
I will be right here waiting for you

\begin{song1}{Without You}{Harry Nilsson}
\noindent
No, I can't forget this evening\\
Or your face as you were leaving\\
But I guess that's just the way the story goes\\
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows\\
Yes, it shows\\
\\
No, I can't forget tomorrow\\
When I think of all my sorrow\\
When I had you there but then I let you go\\
And now it's only fair that I should let you know\\
What you should know\\
\\
I can't live if living is without you\\
I can't live, I can't give any more\\
I can't live if living is without you\\
I can't give, I can't give any more\\
\\
No, I can't forget this evening\\
Or your face as you were leaving\\
But I guess that's just the way the story goes\\
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows\\
Yes, it shows\\
\\
I can't live if living is without you\\
I can't live, I can't give anymore\\
I can't live if living is without you\\
I can't live, I can't give anymore

\noindent
Lay down\\
Your sweet and weary head\\
Night is falling\\
You have come to journey's end\\
\\
Sleep now\\
And dream of the ones who came before\\
They are calling\\
From across the distant shore\\
\\
Why do you weep?\\
What are these tears upon your face?\\
Soon you will see\\
All of your fears will pass away\\
\\
Safe in my arms\\
You're only sleeping\\
\\
What can you see\\
On the horizon?\\
Why do the white gulls call?\\
\\
Across the sea\\
A pale moon rises\\
The ships have come\\
To carry you home\\
\\
And all will turn to silver glass\\
Lights on the water\\
All souls pass\\
\vfill
\columnbreak
\noindent
Hope fades\\
Into the world of night\\
Through shadows falling\\
Out of memory and time\\
\\
Don't say\\
We have come now to the end\\
White shores are calling\\
You and I will meet again\\
\\
And you'll be here in my arms\\
Just sleeping\\
\\
What can you see\\
On the horizon?\\
Why do the white gulls call?\\
\\
Across the sea\\
A pale moon rises\\
The ships have come\\
To carry you home\\
And all will turn to silver glass\\
Lights on the water\\
Grey ships pass\\
Into the West

\begin{song1}{Poison}{Alice Cooper}
\noindent
Your cruel device\\
Your blood, like ice\\
One look, could kill\\
My pain, your thrill\\
\\
I wanna love you but I better not touch (don’t touch)\\
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop\\
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much (too much)\\
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison\\
You’re poison, running through my veins\\
You're poison, I don’t wanna break these chains\\
\\
Your mouth, so hot\\
Your web, I’m caught\\
Your skin, so wet\\
Black lace, on sweat\\
\\
I hear you calling and it’s needles and pins (and pins)\\
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name\\
Don’t wanna touch you but you’re under my skin (deep in)\\
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison\\
You’re poison, running through my veins\\
Your poison\\
I don’t wanna break these chains\\
Poison...\\
\\
One look, could kill\\
My pain, your thrill\\
\\
I wanna love you...\\
Poison...

\noindent
Oh the wind whistles down\\
The cold dark street tonight\\
And the people, they were dancing\\ 
To the music vibe\\
And the boys chase the girls\\ 
With the curls in their hair\\
While the shy tormented youth\\ 
Sit way over there\\
And the songs they get louder\\
Each one better than before\\
\\
And you're singing the songs\\
Thinking this is the life\\
And you wake up in the morning\\
And your head feels twice the size\\
Where you gonna go,\\
Where you gonna go?\\
Where you gonna sleep tonight?\\
\\
And you're singing the songs\\
Thinking this is the life\\
And you wake up in the morning\\
And your head feels twice the size\\
Where you gonna go,\\
Where you gonna go?\\
Where you gonna sleep tonight?\\
Where you gonna sleep tonight?\\

So you're heading down the road\\ 
In your taxi for four\\
And your waiting\\ 
Outside Jimmy's front door\\
But nobody's in, nobody's home till four\\
So you're sitting there with nothing to do\\
Talking about Robert Riger\\ 
And his motley crew\\
And where you're gonna go?\\
Where you're gonna sleep tonight?\\

And you're singing the songs...\\

\begin{song1}{House Of The Rising Sun}{Animals}
\noindent
There is a house in New Orleans\\
They call the Rising Sun\\
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy\\
And God, I know I'm one\\
\\
My mother was a tailor\\
Sewed my new blue jeans\\
My father was a gamblin' man\\
Down in New Orleans\\
\\
Now the only thing a gambler needs\\
Is a suitcase and a trunk\\
And the only time he'll be satisfied\\
Is when he's all drunk\\
\\
Oh, mother, tell your children\\
Not to do what I have done\\
Spend your lives in sin and misery\\
In the house of the Rising Sun\\
\\
Well I've got one foot on the platform\\
The other foot on the train\\
I'm going back to New Orleans\\
To wear that ball and chain\\
\\
Well there is a house in New Orleans\\
They call the Rising Sun\\
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy\\
And God, I know I'm one\\

\begin{song2}{Memory}{Barbra Streisand}
\noindent
Midnight,\\
Not a sound from the pavement.\\
Has the moon lost her memory?\\
She is smiling alone.\\
In the lamp light the withered leaves\\
collect at my feet.\\
And the wind begins to moan.\\
\\
Memory!\\
All alone in the moonlight\\
I can dream of the old days,\\
Life was beautiful then.\\
I remember the time I knew\\ 
what happiness was,\\
Let the memory live again.\\
\\
Every street lamp seems to beat\\
a fatalistic warning.\\
Someone mutters\\ 
And the street lamp gutters\\
and soon it will be morning.\\
\\
Daylight\\
I must wait for the sunrise,\\
I must think of a new life\\
And I mustn't give in.\\
When the dawn comes\\
tonight will be a memory too\\
And a new day will begin.\\
\vfill
\columnbreak
\noindent
Burnt out ends of smoky days,\\
the still cold smell of morning.\\
A street lamp dies,\\
another night is over,\\
another day is dawning.\\
\\
Touch me.\\
It's so easy to leave me\\
All alone with the memory\\
Of my days in the sun.\\
If you touch me\\
you'll understand what happiness is.\\
Look -- a new day has begun.\\

Life is a moment in space,\\
When the dream is gone\\
It's a lonelier place.\\
I kiss the morning goodbye,\\
But down inside you know\\
We never know why.\\
\\
The road is narrow and long\\
When eyes meet eyes\\
And the feeling is strong.\\
I turn away from the wall.\\
I stumble and fall,\\
But I give you it all.\\
\\
I am a woman in love\\
And I'd do anything\\
To get you into my world,\\
And hold you within.\\
It's a right I defend\\
Over and over again.\\
What do I do?\\
\\
With you eternally mine,\\
In love there is\\
No measure of time.\\
We planned it all at the start\\
That you and I live\\
In each others heart.\\

We may be oceans away,\\
You feel my love\\
I hear what you say.\\
No truth is ever a lie.\\
I stumble and fall,\\
But I give you it all.\\

And I'd do anything\\
To get you into my world,\\
And hold you within.\\
It's a right I defend\\
Over and over again.\\
What do I do?\\

I am a woman in love\\
And I'm talkin' to you.\\
You know (I know) how you feel\\
What a woman can do.\\
It's a right I defend\\
Over and over again\\

Although I have to go\\
It makes me feel like crying\\
I don't know when I'll see you again\\

Darling leave a light on for me\\
I'll be there before you close the door\\
To give you all the love that you need\\
Darling leave a light on for me\\
'cause when the world takes me away\\
You are still the air that I breathe\\
\\
I can't explain I don't know\\
Just how far I have to go\\
But darling I'll keep the key\\
Just leave a light on for me\\
\\
Yes, I know\\
What I'm asking is crazy\\
You could go\\
Just get tired of waiting\\
But if I lose your love\\
Torn out by my desire\\
That would be the one regret of my life\\

Darling leave a light on for me...\\

Just like a spark lights up the dark\\
Baby that's your heart, baby that's your heart, baby that's your heart!

Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind.\\

There's a lady who's sure\\ 
all that glitters is gold\\

Ooh, ooh...\\

There's a sign on the wall\\

there's a songbird who sings,\\
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.\\

Ooh, it makes me wonder $\times2$\\

There's a feeling I get\\ 
when I look to the West,\\
And my spirit is crying for leaving.\\
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke\\
through the trees,\\
And the voices of those who stand looking.\\
\\
Ooh, it makes me wonder,\\
Ooh, really makes me wonder.\\
\\
And it's whispered that soon\\
if we all call the tune\\
Then the piper will lead us to reason.\\
And a new day will dawn for those\\
who stand long\\
And the forests will echo with laughter.\\
Ooh...\\
\\
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow,\\ 
don't be alarmed now,\\
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.\\
Yes, there are two paths you can go by,\\
but in the long run\\
There's still time\\
to change the road you're on.\\
\\
And it makes me wonder. Ooh...\\
\\
Your head is humming and it won't go,\\
in case you don't know,\\
The piper's calling you to join him,\\
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,\\
and did you know\\
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.\\
\\
And as we wind on down the road\\
Our shadows taller than our soul.\\
There walks a lady we all know\\
Who shines white light and wants to show\\
How everything still turns to gold.\\
And if you listen very hard\\
The tune will come to you at last.\\
When all are one and one is all\\
To be a rock and not to roll.\\

And in my dreams I've kissed your lips\\
A thousand times\\
I sometimes see you\\
Pass outside my door\\
\\
Hello!\\
Is it me you're looking for?\\
I can see it in your eyes\\
I can see it in your smile\\
You're all I've ever wanted\\
And my arms are open wide\\
'Cause you know just what to say\\
And you know just what to do\\
And I want to tell you so much\\
I love you\\
\\
I long to see the sunlight in your hair\\
And tell you time and time again\\
How much I care\\
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow\\
\\
Hello!\\
I've just got to let you know\\
'Cause I wonder where you are\\
And I wonder what you do\\
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?\\
Or is someone loving you?\\
Tell me how to win your heart\\
For I haven't got a clue\\
But let me start by saying\\
I love you

Just a perfect day\\
Drink Sangria in the park\\
And then later\\
When it gets dark, we go home\\
\\
Just a perfect day\\
Feed animals in the zoo\\
Then later\\
A movie, too, and then home\\
\\
Oh, it's such a perfect day\\
I'm glad I spend it with you\\
Oh, such a perfect day\\
You just keep me hanging on\\
You just keep me hanging on\\
\\
Just a perfect day\\
Problems all left alone\\
Weekenders on our own\\
It's such fun\\
\\
Just a perfect day\\
You made me forget myself\\
I thought I was\\
Someone else, someone good\\
\\
Oh, it's such a perfect day\\
I'm glad I spent it with you\\
Oh, such a perfect day\\
You just keep me hanging on\\
You just keep me hanging on\\

\noindent
Call you up in the middle of the night\\
Like a firefly without a light\\
You were there like a blowtorch burning\\
I was a key that could use a little turning\\
\\
So tired that I couldn't even sleep\\
So many secrets I couldn't keep\\
I promised myself I wouldn't weep\\
One more promise I couldn't keep\\
\\
It seems no one can help me now,\\
I'm in too deep; there's no way out\\
This time I have really led myself astray\\
\\
Runaway train, never going back\\
Wrong way on a one-way track\\
Seems like I should be getting somewhere\\
Somehow I'm neither here nor there\\
\\
Can you help me remember how to smile?\\
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile\\
How on earth did I get so jaded?\\
Life's mystery seems so faded\\
\\
I can go where no one else can go\\
I know what no one else knows\\
Here I am just a-drownin' in the rain\\
With a ticket for a runaway train\\
\\
And everything seems cut and dried,\\
Day and night, earth and sky,\\
Somehow I just don't believe it\\

Runaway train, never going back\\

Somehow I'm neither here nor there\\

Bought a ticket for a runaway train\\
Like a madman laughing at the rain\\
A little out of touch, a little insane\\
It's just easier than dealing with the pain\\
\\
Runaway train, never going back\\
Wrong way on a one-way track\\
Seems like I should be getting somewhere\\
Somehow I'm neither here nor there\\
\\
Runaway train, never coming back\\
Runaway train, tearing up the track\\
Runaway train, burning in my veins\\
I run away but it always seems the same

A long, long time ago...\\
I can still remember\\
How that music used to make me smile.\\
And I knew if I had my chance\\
That I could make those people dance\\
And, maybe, they'd be happy for a while.\\
\\
But february made me shiver\\
With every paper I'd deliver.\\
Bad news on the doorstep;\\
I couldn't take one more step.\\
\\
I can't remember if I cried\\
When I read about his widowed bride,\\
But something touched me deep inside\\
The day the music died.\\
\\
So\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie.\\
Drove my chevy to the levee,\\
But the levee was dry.\\
And them good old boys\\ 
Were drinkin' whiskey and rye\\
Singin', "this'll be the day that I die."\\
"This'll be the day that I die."\\
\\
Did you write the book of love,\\
And do you have faith in God above,\\
If the Bible tells you so?\\
Do you believe in rock'n'roll,\\
Can music save your mortal soul,\\
And can you teach me\\ 
How to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him\\
`Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym.\\
You both kicked off your shoes.\\
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues.\\
\\
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck\\
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck,\\
But I knew I was out of luck\\
The day the music died.\\
\\
I started singin',\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...\\
\\
Now for ten years we've been on our own\\
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone,\\
But that's not how it used to be.\\
When the jester sang\\ 
For the king and queen,\\
In a coat he borrowed from james dean\\
And a voice that came from you and me\\
\\
Oh, and while the king was looking down,\\
The jester stole his thorny crown.\\
The courtroom was adjourned;\\
No verdict was returned.\\
And while Lennon read a book of marx,\\
The quartet practiced in the park,\\
And we sang dirges in the dark\\
The day the music died.\\
\\
We were singing,\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...\\
\\
Helter skelter in a summer swelter.\\
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter,\\
Eight miles high and falling fast.\\
It landed foul on the grass.\\
The players tried for a forward pass,\\
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast.\\
\\
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume\\
While the sergeants\\ 
Played a marching tune.\\
We all got up to dance,\\
Oh, but we never got the chance!\\
`Cause the players tried to take the field;\\
The marching band refused to yield.\\
Do you recall what was revealed\\
The day the music died?\\
\\
We started singing\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...\\
\\
Oh, and there we were all in one place,\\
A generation lost in space\\
With no time left to start again.\\
So come on: jack be nimble, jack be quick!\\
Jack flash sat on a candlestick\\
Cause fire is the devil's only friend.\\
\\
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage\\
My hands were clenched in fists of rage.\\
No angel born in hell\\
Could break that satan's spell.\\
And as the flames\\
Climbed high into the night\\
To light the sacrificial rite,\\
I saw satan laughing with delight\\
The day the music died
\vfill

\noindent
He was singing\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...\\
\\
I met a girl who sang the blues\\
And I asked her for some happy news,\\
But she just smiled and turned away.\\
I went down to the sacred store\\
Where I'd heard the music years before,\\
But the man there said\\
The music wouldn't play.\\
\\
And in the streets: the children screamed,\\
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed.\\
But not a word was spoken;\\
The church bells all were broken.\\
And the three men I admire most:\\
The father, son, and the holy ghost,\\
They caught the last train for the coast\\
The day the music died.\\
\\
And they were singing\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...\\
\\
They were singing\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...

On a dark desert highway,\\ 
Cold wind in my hair\\
Warm smell of colitas \\
Rising up through the air\\
Up ahead in the distance\\ 
I saw a shimmering light\\
My head grew heavy \\
And my sight grew dim.\\
I had to stop for the night.\\
\\
There she stood in the doorway \\
I heard the mission bell\\
And I was thinkin' to myself\\
This could be heaven or this could be hell\\
Then she lit up a candle \\
And she showed me the way\\
There were voices down the corridor\\ 
I thought I heard them say\\
\\
Welcome to the Hotel California\\
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)\\ 
Such a lovely face\\
Plenty of room at the Hotel California\\
Any time of year (Any time of year)\\ 
You can find it here\\
\\
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted\\ 
She got the Mercedes Bends\\
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys\\ 
She calls friends\\
How they dance in the courtyard\\ 
Sweet summer sweat\\
Some dance to remember\\ 
Some dance to forget
\vfill

So I called up the Captain\\ 
"Please bring me my wine"\\
He said "We haven't had that spirit here\\ 
Since nineteen sixty-nine"\\
And still those voices are calling\\ 
From far away\\
Wake you up in the middle of the night\\ 
Just to hear them say\\
\\
Welcome to the Hotel California\\
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)\\ 
Such a lovely face\\
They livin' it up at the Hotel California\\
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)\\
Bring your alibis\\
\\
Mirrors on the ceiling\\
The pink champagne on ice\\
And she said "We are all just prisoners here\\ 
Of our own device"\\
And in the masters chambers\\ 
They gathered for the feast\\
They stab it with their steely knives\\
But they just can't kill the beast\\
\\
Last thing I remember \\
I was running for the door\\
I had to find the passage\\ 
back to the place I was before\\
''Relax,'' said the night man,\\ 
''We are programmed to receive\\
You can check out anytime you like\\ 
But you can never leave."

Words like violence\\
Break the silence\\
Come crashing in\\
Into my little world\\
Painful to me\\
Pierce right through me\\
Can’t you understand\\
Oh my little girl\\
\\
All I ever wanted\\
All I ever needed\\
Is here in my arms\\
Words are very unnecessary\\
They can only do the harm\\
\\
Vows are spoken\\
To be broken\\
Feelings are intense\\
Words are trivial\\
Pleasures remain\\
So does the pain\\
Words are meaningless\\
And forgettable\\

I just called to say I love you\\

No harvest moon to light one tender August night\\
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves\\
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies\\
No libra sun, no Halloween\\
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring\\
But what it is, though old so new\\
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do\\

But she wouldn't think of battle that\\
Reduces men to animals\\
So easy to begin\\
And yet impossible to end\\
For she's the mother of all men\\
Who counselled me so wisely then\\
I feared to walk alone again\\
And asked if she would stay\\
Aaa...\\
\vfill
\columnbreak
\noindent
Oh lady lend your hand outright\\
And let me rest here at your side\\
Have faith and trust\\
In peace she said\\
And filled my heart with life\\
There is no strength in numbers\\
Have no such misconception\\
But when you need me\\
Be assured I won't be far away\\
Aaa...\\
\\
Thus having spoke she turned away\\
And though I found no words to say\\
I stood and watched until I saw\\
Her black coat disappear\\
My labour is no easier\\
But now I know I'm not alone\\
I find new heart each time\\
I think upon that windy day\\
And if one day she comes to you\\
Drink deeply from her words so wise\\
Take courage from her\\
As your prize\\
And say hello from me\\
Aaa...

\begin{song1}{shape of my heart}{sting}
\noindent
He deals the cards as a meditation\\
And those he plays never suspect\\
He doesn't play for the money he wins\\
He don't play for respect\\
He deals the cards to find the answer\\
The secret geometry of chance\\
The hidden law of probable outcome\\
The numbers lead a dance\\
\\
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier\\
I know that the clubs are weapons of war\\
I know that diamonds mean money for this art\\
But that's not the shape of my heart\\
\\
He may play the jack of diamonds\\
He may lay the queen of spades\\
He may conceal a king in his hand\\
While the memory of it fades\\
\\
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier...\\
That's not the shape, shape of my heart\\
\\
And if I told you that I loved you\\
You'd maybe think there's something wrong\\
I'm not a man of too many faces\\
The mask I wear is one\\
Those who speak know nothing\\
And find out to their cost\\
Like those who curse their luck in too many places\\
And those who fear are lost\\
\\
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier...

\begin{song1}{I'm Still Standing}{elton john}
\noindent
You could never know what it's like.\\
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice\\
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you.\\
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide \\
behind that mask you use.\\
\\
And did you think this fool could never win?\\
Well look at me, I'm coming back again!\\
I got a taste of love in a simple way,\\
And if you need to know while I'm still standing\\
you just fade away!\\
\\
Don't you know I'm still standing\\ 
better than I ever did?\\
Looking like a true survivor,\\ 
feeling like a little kid!\\
I'm still standing after all this time,\\
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind!\\
\\
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
\\
Once I never could hope to win,\\
You starting down the road leaving me again.\\
The threats you made were meant to cut me down;\\
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now\\
\\
Don't you know I'm still standing...\\

Wise men say only fools rush in\\
But I can't help falling in love with you\\
Shall I stay\\
Would it be a sin\\
If I can't help falling in love with you\\

Like a river flows surely to the sea\\
Darling so it goes\\
Some things are meant to be\\
Take my hand, take my whole life too\\
For I can't help falling in love with you\\

We're leaving together,\\
But still it's farewell\\
And maybe we'll come back,\\
To earth, who can tell ?\\
I guess there is no one to blame\\
We're leaving ground (leaving ground)\\
Will things ever be the same again?\\

It's the final countdown!\\

We're heading for Venus\\
And still we stand tall\\
Cause maybe they've seen us\\
And welcome us all, yeah\\

\begin{song1kilku}{Something stupid}{Frank Sinatra}{Nancy Sinatra}{}
\noindent
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time\\
To spend an evening with me\\
And if we go some place to dance\\
I know that there’s a chance you won’t be leaving with me\\
\\
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place\\
And have a drink or two\\
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid\\
Like I love you\\
\\
I can see it in your eyes\\
That you despise the same old lines\\
You heard the night before and though it’s just a line to you\\
For me it’s true\\
And never seemed so right before\\
\\
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say\\
To make the meaning come through\\
But then I think I’ll wait until the evening gets late\\
And I’m alone with you\\
\\
The time is right\\
Your perfume fills my head\\
The stars get red\\
And, oh, the night’s so blue\\
And then I go and spoil it all\\
By saying something stupid\\
Like I love you\\
\\
The time is right...\\
I love you, I love you, I love you

\noindent
It won't be easy, you'll think it strange\\
When I try to explain how I feel\\
That I still need your love\\ 
After all that I've done\\
\\
You won't believe me\\
All you will see is a girl you once knew\\
Although she's dressed up to the nines\\
At sixes and sevens with you\\
\\
I had to let it happen, I had to change\\
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel\\
Looking out of the window,\\ 
Staying out of the sun\\
\\
So I chose freedom\\
Running around, trying everything new\\
But nothing impressed me at all\\
I never expected it to\\
\\
Don't cry for me Argentina\\
The truth is I never left you\\
All through my wild days\\
My mad existence\\
I kept my promise\\
Don't keep your distance\\
\\
And as for fortune, and as for fame\\
I never invited them in\\
Though it seemed to the world\\ 
They were all I desired\\
\vfill
\columnbreak
\noindent
They are illusions\\
They're not\\ 
The solutions they promised to be\\
The answer was here all the time\\
I love you and hope you love me\\

Don't cry for me Argentina\\
\\
Don't cry for me Argentina\\
The truth is I never left you\\
All through my wild days\\
My mad existence\\
I kept my promise\\
Don't keep your distance\\
\\
Have I said too much?\\
There's nothing more I can think of\\ 
To say to you.\\
But all you have to do\\ 
Is look at me to know\\
That every word is true \\

Do you remember chalk hearts melting on a playground wall\\
Do you remember dawn escapes from moon washed college halls\\
Do you remember the cherry blossom in the market square\\
Do you remember I thought it was confetti in our hair\\
\\
By the way, didn't I break your heart?\\
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart\\
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart\\
But you broke mine\\
\\
Kayleigh, is it too late to say I'm sorry?\\
And, Kayleigh, could we get it together again?\\
I just can't go on pretending that it came to a natural end\\
Kayleigh, oh, I never thought I'd miss you\\
And, Kayleigh, I thought that we'd always be friends\\
We said our love would last forever\\
So how did it come to this bitter end?\\
\\
Do you remember barefoot on the lawn with shooting stars\\
Do you remember loving on the floor in Belsize Park\\
Do you remember dancing in stilettoes in the snow\\
Do you remember you never understood I had to go\\
\\
By the way, didn't I break your heart...\\
\\
Kayleigh, I just wanna say I'm sorry\\
But, Kayleigh, I'm too scared to pick up the phone\\
To hear you've found another lover to patch up our broken home...\\
\\
Kayleigh, I'm still trying to write that love song\\
Kayleigh, it's more important to me now you're gone\\
Maybe it will prove that we were right\\
Or it'll prove that I was wrong ?

I was five and he was six\\
We rode on horses made of sticks\\
He wore black and I wore white\\
He would always win the fight\\
\\
Bang bang, he shot me down\\
Bang bang, I hit the ground\\
Bang bang, that awful sound\\
Bang bang, my baby shot me down\\
\\
Seasons came and changed the time\\
When I grew up, I called him mine\\
He would always laugh and say\\
Remember when we used to play\\
\\
Bang bang, I shot you down\\
Bang bang, you hit the ground\\
Bang bang, that awful sound\\
Bang bang , I used to shoot you down\\
\\
Music played and people sang\\
Just for me the church bells rang\\
\\
Now he's gone, I don't know why\\
Until this day, sometimes I cry\\
He didn't even say 'Goodbye'\\
He didn't take the time to lie\\
\\
Bang bang, he shot me down\\
Bang bang, I hit the ground\\
Bang bang, that awful sound\\
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

They call me the Wild Rose\\
But my name was Elisa Day\\
Why they call me it, I do not know\\
For my name was Elisa Day\\
\\
From the first day I saw her\\
I knew she was the one\\
She stared in my eyes and smiled\\
For her lips were the color of the roses\\
They grew down the river,\\ 
All bloody and wild\\
\\
When he knocked on my door\\
And entered the room\\
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace\\
He would be my first man\\
And with a careful hand\\
He wiped up the tears\\ 
That ran down my face\\
\\
They call me the Wild Rose...\\
\\
On the second day I brought her a flower\\
She’s more beautiful\\ 
Than any woman I've seen\\
And I said: “Do you know\\ 
Where the wild roses grow\\
So sweet and scarlet and free?”\\
\vfill
\columnbreak
\noindent
On the second day he came\\ 
With a single rose\\
He said: “Give me your loss\\ 
And your sorrow”\\
I nodded my head as I laid on the bed\\
‘If I show you the roses, will you follow?”\\
\\
They call me the Wild Rose...\\
\\
On the third day\\ 
He took me to the river\\
He showed me the roses and we kissed\\
And the last thing I heard\\
Was a muttered word\\
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist\\
\\
On the last day I took her\\ 
Where the wild roses grow\\
She lay on the bank,\\ 
The wind light as a thief\\
And I kissed her goodbye,\\
Said: “All beauty must die”\\
And I knelt down\\ 
And planted a rose between her teeth\\
\\
They call me the Wild Rose...\\
\\
My name was Elisa Day\\
For my name was Elisa Day\\

\begin{song1}{Killing me softly}{Roberta Flack}
\noindent
Strumming my pain with his fingers\\
Singing my life with his words\\
Killing me softly with his song,\\
Killing me softly with his songs\\
Telling my whole life with his words\\
Killing me softly with his song\\
\\
I heard he sang a good song\\
I heard he had a style\\
And so I came to see him to listen for a while\\
And there he was this young boy\\
A stranger to my eyes\\
\\
Strumming my pain with his fingers...\\
\\
I felt all flushed with fever\\
Embarrassed by the crowd\\
I felt he found my letters and read each out loud\\
I prayed that he would finish\\
But he just kept right on\\
\\
Strumming my pain with his fingers...\\
\\
He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair\\
And then he looked right through me\\
As if I wasn't there\\
And he just kept on singing\\
Singing clear and strong\\
\\
Strumming my pain with his fingers...

Home again 'cross the sea\\

I am flying\\ 
Like a bird 'cross the sky\\
I am flying passing high clouds\\ 
To be with you to be free\\

Can you hear me?\\
Can you hear me\\ 
Thro' the dark night far away\\
I am dying, forever crying\\ 
To be with you who can say.\\

Can you hear me?\\
Can you hear me\\ 
Thro' the dark night far away\\
I am dying, forever crying\\ 
To be with you who can say\\

We are sailing stormy waters\\
