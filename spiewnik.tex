\begin{song2}{RIGHT HERE WAITING}{RICHARD MARX}
\noindent
Oceans apart day after day\\
And I slowly go insane\\
I hear your voice on the line\\
But it doesn't stop the pain\\
\\
If I see you next to never\\
How can we say forever\\
\\
Wherever you go\\
Whatever you do\\
I will be right here waiting for you\\
Whatever it takes\\
Or how my heart breaks\\
I will be right here waiting for you\\
\\
I took for granted, all the times\\
That I though would last somehow\\
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears\\
But I can't get near you now\\
\\
Oh, can't you see it baby\\
You've got me goin' crazy\\
\\
Wherever you go\\
Whatever you do\\
I will be right here waiting for you\\
Whatever it takes\\
Or how my heart breaks\\
I will be right here waiting for you\\
\vfill
\columnbreak
\noindent
I wonder how we can survive\\
This romance\\
But in the end if I'm with you\\
I'll take the chance\\
\\
Oh, can't you see it baby\\
You've got me goin' crazy\\
\\
Wherever you go\\
Whatever you do\\
I will be right here waiting for you\\
Whatever it takes\\
Or how my heart breaks\\
I will be right here waiting for you

\begin{song1}{Without You}{Harry Nilsson}
\noindent
No, I can't forget this evening\\
Or your face as you were leaving\\
But I guess that's just the way the story goes\\
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows\\
Yes, it shows\\
\\
No, I can't forget tomorrow\\
When I think of all my sorrow\\
When I had you there but then I let you go\\
And now it's only fair that I should let you know\\
What you should know\\
\\
I can't live if living is without you\\
I can't live, I can't give any more\\
I can't live if living is without you\\
I can't give, I can't give any more\\
\\
No, I can't forget this evening\\
Or your face as you were leaving\\
But I guess that's just the way the story goes\\
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows\\
Yes, it shows\\
\\
I can't live if living is without you\\
I can't live, I can't give anymore\\
I can't live if living is without you\\
I can't live, I can't give anymore

\noindent
Lay down\\
Your sweet and weary head\\
Night is falling\\
You have come to journey's end\\
\\
Sleep now\\
And dream of the ones who came before\\
They are calling\\
From across the distant shore\\
\\
Why do you weep?\\
What are these tears upon your face?\\
Soon you will see\\
All of your fears will pass away\\
\\
Safe in my arms\\
You're only sleeping\\
\\
What can you see\\
On the horizon?\\
Why do the white gulls call?\\
\\
Across the sea\\
A pale moon rises\\
The ships have come\\
To carry you home\\
\\
And all will turn to silver glass\\
Lights on the water\\
All souls pass\\
\vfill
\columnbreak
\noindent
Hope fades\\
Into the world of night\\
Through shadows falling\\
Out of memory and time\\
\\
Don't say\\
We have come now to the end\\
White shores are calling\\
You and I will meet again\\
\\
And you'll be here in my arms\\
Just sleeping\\
\\
What can you see\\
On the horizon?\\
Why do the white gulls call?\\
\\
Across the sea\\
A pale moon rises\\
The ships have come\\
To carry you home\\
And all will turn to silver glass\\
Lights on the water\\
Grey ships pass\\
Into the West

\begin{song1}{Poison}{Alice Cooper}
\noindent
Your cruel device\\
Your blood, like ice\\
One look, could kill\\
My pain, your thrill\\
\\
I wanna love you but I better not touch (don’t touch)\\
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop\\
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much (too much)\\
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison\\
You’re poison, running through my veins\\
You're poison, I don’t wanna break these chains\\
\\
Your mouth, so hot\\
Your web, I’m caught\\
Your skin, so wet\\
Black lace, on sweat\\
\\
I hear you calling and it’s needles and pins (and pins)\\
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name\\
Don’t wanna touch you but you’re under my skin (deep in)\\
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison\\
You’re poison, running through my veins\\
Your poison\\
I don’t wanna break these chains\\
Poison...\\
\\
One look, could kill\\
My pain, your thrill\\

I wanna love you...\\

\noindent
Oh the wind whistles down\\
The cold dark street tonight\\
And the people, they were dancing\\ 
To the music vibe\\
And the boys chase the girls\\ 
With the curls in their hair\\
While the shy tormented youth\\ 
Sit way over there\\
And the songs they get louder\\
Each one better than before\\
\\
And you're singing the songs\\
Thinking this is the life\\
And you wake up in the morning\\
And your head feels twice the size\\
Where you gonna go,\\
Where you gonna go?\\
Where you gonna sleep tonight?\\
\\
And you're singing the songs\\
Thinking this is the life\\
And you wake up in the morning\\
And your head feels twice the size\\

Where you gonna sleep tonight?\\

So you're heading down the road\\ 
In your taxi for four\\
And your waiting\\ 
Outside Jimmy's front door\\
But nobody's in, nobody's home till four\\
So you're sitting there with nothing to do\\
Talking about Robert Riger\\ 
And his motley crew\\
And where you're gonna go?\\
Where you're gonna sleep tonight?\\

And you're singing the songs...\\

\begin{song1}{House Of The Rising Sun}{Animals}
\noindent
There is a house in New Orleans\\
They call the Rising Sun\\
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy\\
And God, I know I'm one\\
\\
My mother was a tailor\\
Sewed my new blue jeans\\
My father was a gamblin' man\\
Down in New Orleans\\
\\
Now the only thing a gambler needs\\
Is a suitcase and a trunk\\
And the only time he'll be satisfied\\
Is when he's all drunk\\
\\
Oh, mother, tell your children\\
Not to do what I have done\\
Spend your lives in sin and misery\\
In the house of the Rising Sun\\
\\
Well I've got one foot on the platform\\
The other foot on the train\\
I'm going back to New Orleans\\
To wear that ball and chain\\
\\
Well there is a house in New Orleans\\
They call the Rising Sun\\
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy\\
And God, I know I'm one\\

\begin{song2}{Memory}{Barbra Streisand}
\noindent
Midnight,\\
Not a sound from the pavement.\\
Has the moon lost her memory?\\
She is smiling alone.\\
In the lamp light the withered leaves\\
collect at my feet.\\
And the wind begins to moan.\\
\\
Memory!\\
All alone in the moonlight\\
I can dream of the old days,\\
Life was beautiful then.\\
I remember the time I knew\\ 
what happiness was,\\
Let the memory live again.\\
\\
Every street lamp seems to beat\\
a fatalistic warning.\\
Someone mutters\\ 
And the street lamp gutters\\
and soon it will be morning.\\
\\
Daylight\\
I must wait for the sunrise,\\
I must think of a new life\\
And I mustn't give in.\\
When the dawn comes\\
tonight will be a memory too\\
And a new day will begin.\\
\vfill
\columnbreak
\noindent
Burnt out ends of smoky days,\\
the still cold smell of morning.\\
A street lamp dies,\\
another night is over,\\
another day is dawning.\\
\\
Touch me.\\
It's so easy to leave me\\
All alone with the memory\\
Of my days in the sun.\\
If you touch me\\
you'll understand what happiness is.\\
Look -- a new day has begun.\\

Life is a moment in space,\\
When the dream is gone\\
It's a lonelier place.\\
I kiss the morning goodbye,\\
But down inside you know\\
We never know why.\\
\\
The road is narrow and long\\
When eyes meet eyes\\
And the feeling is strong.\\
I turn away from the wall.\\
I stumble and fall,\\
But I give you it all.\\
\\
I am a woman in love\\
And I'd do anything\\
To get you into my world,\\
And hold you within.\\
It's a right I defend\\
Over and over again.\\
What do I do?\\
\\
With you eternally mine,\\
In love there is\\
No measure of time.\\
We planned it all at the start\\
That you and I live\\
In each others heart.\\

We may be oceans away,\\
You feel my love\\
I hear what you say.\\
No truth is ever a lie.\\

And I'd do anything\\
To get you into my world,\\
And hold you within.\\
It's a right I defend\\
Over and over again.\\
What do I do?\\

I am a woman in love\\
And I'm talkin' to you.\\
You know (I know) how you feel\\
What a woman can do.\\
It's a right I defend\\
Over and over again\\

Although I have to go\\
It makes me feel like crying\\
I don't know when I'll see you again\\

Darling leave a light on for me\\
I'll be there before you close the door\\
To give you all the love that you need\\
Darling leave a light on for me\\
'cause when the world takes me away\\
You are still the air that I breathe\\
\\
I can't explain I don't know\\
Just how far I have to go\\
But darling I'll keep the key\\
Just leave a light on for me\\
\\
Yes, I know\\
What I'm asking is crazy\\
You could go\\
Just get tired of waiting\\
But if I lose your love\\
Torn out by my desire\\
That would be the one regret of my life\\

Darling leave a light on for me...\\

Just like a spark lights up the dark\\
Baby that's your heart, baby that's your heart, baby that's your heart!

Ooh, ooh...\\

Ooh, it makes me wonder $\times2$\\

There's a feeling I get\\

Ooh, it makes me wonder,\\
Ooh, really makes me wonder.\\

And it's whispered that soon\\
if we all call the tune\\
Then the piper will lead us to reason.\\
And a new day will dawn for those\\
who stand long\\
And the forests will echo with laughter.\\
Ooh...\\

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow,\\ 
don't be alarmed now,\\
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.\\
Yes, there are two paths you can go by,\\

There's still time\\
to change the road you're on.\\

And it makes me wonder. Ooh...\\
\\
Your head is humming and it won't go,\\
in case you don't know,\\
The piper's calling you to join him,\\
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,\\
and did you know\\
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.\\
\\
And as we wind on down the road\\
Our shadows taller than our soul.\\
There walks a lady we all know\\
Who shines white light and wants to show\\
How everything still turns to gold.\\
And if you listen very hard\\
The tune will come to you at last.\\
When all are one and one is all\\
To be a rock and not to roll.\\

Call you up in the middle of the night\\
Like a firefly without a light\\
You were there like a blowtorch burning\\
I was a key that could use a little turning\\

So tired that I couldn't even sleep\\
So many secrets I couldn't keep\\
I promised myself I wouldn't weep\\
One more promise I couldn't keep\\
\\
It seems no one can help me now,\\
I'm in too deep; there's no way out\\
This time I have really led myself astray\\

Runaway train, never going back\\
Wrong way on a one-way track\\
Seems like I should be getting somewhere\\
Somehow I'm neither here nor there\\
\\
Can you help me remember how to smile?\\
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile\\
How on earth did I get so jaded?\\
Life's mystery seems so faded\\
\\
I can go where no one else can go\\
I know what no one else knows\\
Here I am just a-drownin' in the rain\\
With a ticket for a runaway train\\

And everything seems cut and dried,\\
Day and night, earth and sky,\\
Somehow I just don't believe it\\
\vfill

\noindent
Runaway train, never going back\\
Wrong way on a one-way track\\
Seems like I should be getting somewhere\\
Somehow I'm neither here nor there\\
\\
Bought a ticket for a runaway train\\
Like a madman laughing at the rain\\
A little out of touch, a little insane\\
It's just easier than dealing with the pain\\
\\
Runaway train, never going back\\
Wrong way on a one-way track\\
Seems like I should be getting somewhere\\
Somehow I'm neither here nor there\\
\\
Runaway train, never coming back\\
Runaway train, tearing up the track\\
Runaway train, burning in my veins\\
I run away but it always seems the same

\noindent
Tonight I celebrate my love for you\\
It seems the natural thing to do\\
Tonight no one's gonna find us\\
We'll leave the world behind us\\
When I make love to you\\
Tonight I celebrate my love for you\\
And hope that deep inside you feel it too\\
Tonight our spirits will be climbing\\
To the sky lit up with diamonds\\
When I make love to you tonight\\
\\
Tonight I celebrate my love for you (ooh)\\
And that midnight song is gonna come shining through\\
Tonight there'll be no distance between us\\
What I want most to do\\
Is to get close to you tonight\\
\\
Tonight I celebrate my love for you\\
And soon this old world will seem brand new\\
Tonight we will both discover\\
How friends turn into lovers\\
When I make love to you\\
\\
Tonight I celebrate my love for you (ooh)\\
And that midnight song is gonna come shining through\\
Tonight there'll be no distance between us\\
What I want most to do\\
Is to get close to you\\

Tonight I celebrate my love for you \\

\noindent
Risin' up, back on the street\\
Did my time, took my chances\\
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet\\
Just a man and his will to survive\\
\\
So many times, it happens too fast\\
You change your passion for glory\\
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past\\
You must fight just to keep them alive\\
\\
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight\\
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival\\
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night\\
And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger\\
\\
Face to face, out in the heat\\
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry\\
They stack the odds 'till we take to the street\\
For we kill with the skill to survive\\
\\
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight...\\
\\
Risin' up, straight to the top\\
Have the guts, got the glory\\
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop\\
Just a man and his will to survive\\
\\
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight...\\
\\
The eye of the tiger... $\times 4$

\begin{song2}{American Pie}{Don McLean}
\noindent
A long, long time ago...\\
I can still remember\\
How that music used to make me smile.\\
And I knew if I had my chance\\
That I could make those people dance\\
And, maybe, they'd be happy for a while.\\
\\
But february made me shiver\\
With every paper I'd deliver.\\
Bad news on the doorstep;\\
I couldn't take one more step.\\
\\
I can't remember if I cried\\
When I read about his widowed bride,\\
But something touched me deep inside\\
The day the music died.\\
\\
So\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie.\\
Drove my chevy to the levee,\\
But the levee was dry.\\
And them good old boys\\ 
Were drinkin' whiskey and rye\\
Singin', "this'll be the day that I die."\\
"This'll be the day that I die."\\
\\
Did you write the book of love,\\
And do you have faith in God above,\\
If the Bible tells you so?\\
Do you believe in rock'n'roll,\\
Can music save your mortal soul,\\
And can you teach me\\ 
How to dance real slow?
\vfill

\noindent
Well, I know that you're in love with him\\
`Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym.\\
You both kicked off your shoes.\\
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues.\\
\\
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck\\
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck,\\
But I knew I was out of luck\\
The day the music died.\\
\\
I started singin',\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...\\
\\
Now for ten years we've been on our own\\
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone,\\
But that's not how it used to be.\\
When the jester sang\\ 
For the king and queen,\\
In a coat he borrowed from james dean\\
And a voice that came from you and me\\
\\
Oh, and while the king was looking down,\\
The jester stole his thorny crown.\\
The courtroom was adjourned;\\
No verdict was returned.\\
And while Lennon read a book of marx,\\
The quartet practiced in the park,\\
And we sang dirges in the dark\\
The day the music died.\\
\\
We were singing,\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...\\
\\
Helter skelter in a summer swelter.\\
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter,\\
Eight miles high and falling fast.\\
It landed foul on the grass.\\
The players tried for a forward pass,\\
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast.\\
\\
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume\\
While the sergeants\\ 
Played a marching tune.\\
We all got up to dance,\\
Oh, but we never got the chance!\\
`Cause the players tried to take the field;\\
The marching band refused to yield.\\
Do you recall what was revealed\\
The day the music died?\\
\\
We started singing\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...\\
\\
Oh, and there we were all in one place,\\
A generation lost in space\\
With no time left to start again.\\
So come on: jack be nimble, jack be quick!\\
Jack flash sat on a candlestick\\
Cause fire is the devil's only friend.\\
\\
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage\\
My hands were clenched in fists of rage.\\
No angel born in hell\\
Could break that satan's spell.\\
And as the flames\\
Climbed high into the night\\
To light the sacrificial rite,\\
I saw satan laughing with delight\\
The day the music died
\vfill
\columnbreak
\noindent
He was singing\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...\\
\\
I met a girl who sang the blues\\
And I asked her for some happy news,\\
But she just smiled and turned away.\\
I went down to the sacred store\\
Where I'd heard the music years before,\\
But the man there said\\
The music wouldn't play.\\
\\
And in the streets: the children screamed,\\
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed.\\
But not a word was spoken;\\
The church bells all were broken.\\
And the three men I admire most:\\
The father, son, and the holy ghost,\\
They caught the last train for the coast\\
The day the music died.\\
\\
And they were singing\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...\\
\\
They were singing\\
Bye-bye, miss american pie...

\noindent
On a dark desert highway,\\ 
Cold wind in my hair\\
Warm smell of colitas \\
Rising up through the air\\
Up ahead in the distance\\ 
I saw a shimmering light\\
My head grew heavy \\
And my sight grew dim.\\
I had to stop for the night.\\
\\
There she stood in the doorway \\
I heard the mission bell\\
And I was thinkin' to myself\\
This could be heaven or this could be hell\\
Then she lit up a candle \\
And she showed me the way\\
There were voices down the corridor\\ 
I thought I heard them say\\
\\
Welcome to the Hotel California\\
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)\\ 
Such a lovely face\\
Plenty of room at the Hotel California\\
Any time of year (Any time of year)\\ 
You can find it here\\
\\
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted\\ 
She got the Mercedes Bends\\
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys\\ 
She calls friends\\
How they dance in the courtyard\\ 
Sweet summer sweat\\
Some dance to remember\\ 
Some dance to forget
\vfill
\columnbreak
\noindent
So I called up the Captain\\ 
"Please bring me my wine"\\
He said "We haven't had that spirit here\\ 
Since nineteen sixty-nine"\\
And still those voices are calling\\ 
From far away\\
Wake you up in the middle of the night\\ 
Just to hear them say\\
\\
Welcome to the Hotel California\\
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)\\ 
Such a lovely face\\
They livin' it up at the Hotel California\\
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)\\
Bring your alibis\\
\\
Mirrors on the ceiling\\
The pink champagne on ice\\
And she said "We are all just prisoners here\\ 
Of our own device"\\
And in the masters chambers\\ 
They gathered for the feast\\
They stab it with their steely knives\\
But they just can't kill the beast\\
\\
Last thing I remember \\
I was running for the door\\
I had to find the passage\\ 
back to the place I was before\\
''Relax,'' said the night man,\\ 
''We are programmed to receive\\
You can check out anytime you like\\ 
But you can never leave."

\begin{song1}{Enjoy the Silence}{Depeche Mode}
\noindent
Words like violence\\
Break the silence\\
Come crashing in\\
Into my little world\\
Painful to me\\
Pierce right through me\\
Can’t you understand\\
Oh my little girl\\
\\
All I ever wanted\\
All I ever needed\\
Is here in my arms\\
Words are very unnecessary\\
They can only do the harm\\
\\
Vows are spoken\\
To be broken\\
Feelings are intense\\
Words are trivial\\
Pleasures remain\\
So does the pain\\
Words are meaningless\\
And forgettable\\
\\
All I ever wanted... $\times 3$\\

Enjoy the silence

No new years's day to celebrate\\
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away\\
No first of spring, no song to sing\\
In fact here's just another ordinary day\\
No April rain, no flowers bloom\\
No wedding Saturday within the month of June\\
But what it is, is something true\\
Made up of these three words that I must say to you\\
\\
I just called to say I love you\\
I just called to say how much I care\\
I just called to say I love you\\
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart\\

No summer's high, no warm July\\
No harvest moon to light one tender August night\\
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves\\
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies\\
No libra sun, no Halloween\\
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring\\
But what it is, though old so new\\
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do\\
\\
I just called to say I love you\\
I just called to say how much I care about you\\
I just called to say I love you\\
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart\\
